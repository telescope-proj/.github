## Telescope Project

The Telescope Project creates high-performance uncompressed remote desktop
solutions with RDMA technology, providing a level of image quality and latency
unmatched by contemporary solutions on very fast networks.  

This experimental project was initially part of our undergrad coursework, but
will continue to receive new features in the future.
